= MethodCache

MethodCache lets you easily cache the results of any instance method or class method in
Ruby.

== Usage:

  class Foo
    extend Ifttt::MethodCache

    cache_method :bar
    def bar
      # do expensive calculation
    end
    
    cache_class_method :baz, :clone => true, :expiry => 1.day
    def self.baz
      # do some expensive calculation that will be invalid tomorrow
    end
  end

  foo = Foo.new
  foo.bar # does calculation
  foo.bar # cached
  
  Foo.baz # does calculation
  Foo.baz # cached
  
  Foo.invalidate_cached_method(:baz)

  Foo.baz # does calculation
  Foo.baz # cached

== Install:

  gem install method_cache

=== About instances

*This is important, please make sure you understand it*

By default this method will qualify the key based on an instance hash. 

That is, by default, every instance will cache to a *different* key, even given the same arguments. (This makes sense, technically all the instance variables of an object are arguments and thus the output could be different.)

If you want all instance to share a cache for a given set of arguments, first, consider making this a class method and calling that. Second, if you absolutely have to have it be an instance method, define #string_hash on your method and, if that method is consistent, all the instances will share a hash key for a given set of arguments.
